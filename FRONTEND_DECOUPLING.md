# Frontend Decoupling from Convex

## Summary
Successfully decoupled the frontend from Convex dependencies. The frontend now communicates exclusively with the backend via REST API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Convex Dependencies**
- Removed `convex` package from `frontend/package.json`
- Removed `ConvexProvider` and `ConvexReactClient` from `frontend/src/main.tsx`
- Removed all `import { useQuery, useMutation } from "convex/react"` statements
- Removed all `import { api } from "../../../../convex/_generated/api"` statements

### 2. **Updated Files**

#### **frontend/src/main.tsx**
- Removed ConvexProvider wrapper
- App now only wrapped with GoogleOAuthProvider and BrowserRouter

#### **frontend/src/pages/Booking/Booking.jsx**
- Replaced Convex `useQuery` with API call to `GET /api/bookings`
- Replaced Convex `deleteBooking` mutation with API call to `DELETE /api/bookings/:id`
- Added `fetchBookings()` function that fetches from API
- Backend DELETE endpoint handles both Convex and Google Calendar deletion

#### **frontend/src/pages/Service/Service.jsx**
- Replaced Convex `useQuery` with API call to `GET /api/appointment-types`
- Replaced Convex `deleteAppointmentType` mutation with API call to `DELETE /api/appointment-types/:id`
- Added `fetchAppointmentTypes()` function that fetches from API

#### **frontend/src/components/ui/modals/AddAppointmentModal.jsx**
- Removed Convex mutations for create/update
- Replaced with API calls:
  - `POST /api/bookings` for creating
  - `PUT /api/bookings/:id` for updating
- Backend handles Google Calendar sync automatically

#### **frontend/src/components/ui/modals/ServiceModal.jsx**
- Removed Convex mutations for create/update
- Replaced with API calls:
  - `POST /api/appointment-types` for creating
  - `PUT /api/appointment-types/:id` for updating

#### **frontend/src/pages/PublicBooking/PublicBooking.jsx**
- Already using API endpoint `POST /api/bookings`
- No Convex dependencies (clean)

### 3. **Backend API Endpoints Used**

All these endpoints already exist in `backend/routes.ts`:

#### Bookings
- `GET /api/bookings` - Fetch all user bookings
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create booking (with Google Calendar sync)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id` - Update booking (with Google Calendar sync)
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` - Delete booking (with Google Calendar sync)

#### Appointment Types (Services)
- `GET /api/appointment-types` - Fetch all appointment types
- `POST /api/appointment-types` - Create appointment type
- `PUT /api/appointment-types/:id` - Update appointment type
- `DELETE /api/appointment-types/:id` - Delete appointment type

#### Authentication
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user session

#### Google Calendar
- `GET /api/google-calendar/status` - Check connection status
- `GET /api/google-calendar/events` - Fetch calendar events
- `POST /api/google-calendar/events` - Create calendar event
- `PUT /api/google-calendar/events/:id` - Update calendar event
- `DELETE /api/google-calendar/events/:id` - Delete calendar event

## Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: Frontend and backend are now completely decoupled
2. **Easy Deployment**: Frontend can be deployed to Vercel without Convex dependencies
3. **Consistent Architecture**: All data flows through REST API endpoints
4. **Better Error Handling**: API responses provide clear error messages
5. **Session Management**: Backend handles authentication and authorization
6. **Google Calendar Sync**: All sync logic centralized in backend

## Deployment Instructions

### Frontend (Vercel)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Will not install convex package
npm run build
```

No special configuration needed - frontend works standalone!

### Backend (DigitalOcean)
Backend already deployed and working. No changes needed.

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend `.env`
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
```

#### Backend `.env`
```env
# All existing variables remain the same
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:joyous-anteater-586
CONVEX_URL=https://joyous-anteater-586.convex.cloud
# ... etc
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Booking page loads and displays bookings
- [x] Can create new appointments
- [x] Can update appointments
- [x] Can delete appointments (also deletes from Google Calendar)
- [x] Service page loads and displays services
- [x] Can create new services
- [x] Can update services
- [x] Can delete services
- [x] Public booking page works
- [x] Google Calendar sync works bidirectionally
- [x] No Convex imports in frontend
- [x] Frontend builds successfully without Convex

## Notes

- Backend still uses Convex as its database (this is fine!)
- Frontend only communicates with backend via HTTP
- All business logic (validation, Google Calendar sync, etc.) is in the backend
- This is a clean 3-tier architecture: Frontend → Backend API → Convex Database
